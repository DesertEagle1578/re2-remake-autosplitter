# Resident Evil 2 (2019) Autosplitter

Supports all scenarios. 

# Instructions

Edit your splits and change the game name to "Resident Evil 2 2019". A message should pop up saying an autosplitter by me is available. Click "Activate".

After activating the RE2 autosplitter, click "Settings". Place a checkmark next to every split you want to use.

Afterwards, create your splits. Name them anything you want (just make sure they correspond with a checkmarked autosplit). Order them however you'd like.

Make sure you compare against Game Time.

Any problems? Reach out to me.

# I have a split request?

Great, reach out to me through the RE Speedrunning discord, and I'll see what I can do.

# Something didn't split or split at the wrong time.

Make sure you have the split checkmarked as explained above. If that doesn't work, or if a split of yours split at the wrong time, contact me.
